    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        My father works in Cybersecurity, and I've always been amazed at his skill with computers.<br>
        So, when I saw that Coding Temple was teaching people about coding languages, I knew I had to sign up!<br>
        I love traveling, so the idea of working from my laptop anywhere I want is really exciting for me.<br>
        My career goals are simple: I want to be a part of the next big thing in computer science.<br>
        I'm hoping to get into AI development one day.
