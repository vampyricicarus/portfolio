        Above I have attached a snippet of a library management system that I coded!<br>
        I'm very proud of it, because it was a difficult but rewarding task for me.<br>
        It showcases my ability to problem solve and work on large user-friendly programs!<br>
        I used python to code it and worked really hard on it.
